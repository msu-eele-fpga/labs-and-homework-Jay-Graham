# HW 6 - Async Conditioner

## Overview
I designed and tested an asynchronous signal conditioner using a synchronizer, debouncer, and one-pulse generator. I wrote self-checking test benches for the one-pulse generator and the asynchronous signal conditioner to make sure they were working properly. The debouncer was also verified using a provided test bench.
